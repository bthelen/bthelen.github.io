I’ve handledthese writings in various ways at different points of my career, such as: Filling dozens of paper notebooks which I would recycle every few years Writing a personal scratchpad on various wikis that belong to my employer Maintaining a massive .txt file full of random shell script snippets Keeping an Evernote account full of meeting notes (perhaps in violation of my employer’s policies) Starting a Notion workspace full of technical How-Tos that I’ve authoredEach of these schemes has been valuable to me in their day, but none of them hasbeen helpful to anyone else beyond the occasional shared PDF of something I’d written in one of the systems.PurposeThis site aims to expand that limited scope of my previous documentation schemes and allowothers to benefit from my experiences.ScopeI’ll be keeping this focused on Cloud, Linux, Java, Infrastructure Modernization, andApplication Modernization. This means not everything I keep in my Notion workspace willbe published here. No one wants to read any of those technical how-tos that are no longerrelevant because the products are barely in use. In addition, I’ll be keeping all myBBQ recipes to myself as I’m a much better Cloud Engineer than I am a cook!" } ]
