I have always been a prolific documenter and note taker.  I've handled
these writings in various ways at different points of my career, such as:
* Filling dozens of paper notebooks which I would recycle every few years
* Writing a personal scratchpad on various [wikis](https://tiki.org/) that belong to my employer
* Maintaining a massive .txt file full of random shell script snippets
* Keeping an [Evernote](https://evernote.com) account full of meeting notes (*perhaps in violation of my employer's policies*)
* Starting a [Notion](https://notion.so/) workspace full of technical How-Tos that I've authored

Each of these schemes has been valuable to me in their day, but none of them has
been helpful to anyone else beyond the occasional shared PDF of something I'd written in one of the systems.

# Purpose
This site aims to expand that limited scope of my previous documentation schemes and allow
others to benefit from my experiences.

# Scope
I'll be keeping this focused on Cloud, Linux, Java, Infrastructure Modernization, and
Application Modernization.  This means not everything I keep in my Notion workspace will
be published here.  No one wants to read any of those technical how-tos that are no longer
relevant because the products are barely in use.  In addition, I'll be keeping all my
BBQ recipes to myself as I'm a much better Cloud Engineer than I am a cook!
