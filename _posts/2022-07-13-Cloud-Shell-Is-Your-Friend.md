As a Customer Engineer at Google Cloud, I personally interact with the cloud in a variety of ways and I 
get to see the way others interact with the cloud. I've seen everything from the one guy who runs all
the `gcloud` commands for the various teams to git ops, pull request driven Terraform Enterprise based 
workflows that would bring a tear to the eye of even the most strict auditor.
